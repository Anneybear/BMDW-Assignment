# BMDW-Assignment
## Introduction to Large Scale Biomedical Data Analysis and Visualization Workshop Assignment
### Part1: Data analysis using pandas, seaborn, and scipy. Each student will receive a unique dataset containing ~500,000 total rows. This is split into two files, case_data.csv and control_data.csv. Every row will contain 5 phenotypes labeled from A-E. In this part you will be required to do some cleaning, transforming, plotting, and analysis on this dataset.

### Part2: Bioinformatics analysis. Each student will download their data from github for part 2 described below. This dataset will include a gene count matrix and a metadata file. To complete part two of this assignment you will need to use the Deseq2 package in R to perform a differential gene expression analysis as demonstrated in the final breakout session. This section requires that you report the top 6 differentially expressed gene names, and their corresponding adjusted p values. We also require you to submit the figures outlined in the last lecture with differential analysis including the volcano plot, the principal component analysis figure calculated by the variance stabilizing transformation as well as dot plots for each of the six top differentially expressed genes where the x axis has the group and the y axis is the normalized gene counts.
